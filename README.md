# CS231n

This repository includes my solutions to the [CS231n](http://cs231n.github.io), Stanford course in Spring 2018. It's one of the best places to getting started with Deep Learning for Computer Vision.  
You can see the course material at [CS231n.github.io](http://cs231n.github.io) and watch the recorded lectures at [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLC1qU-LWwrF64f4QKQT-Vg5Wr4qEE1Zxk).
